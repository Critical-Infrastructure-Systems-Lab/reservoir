#' @title Storage-Reliability-Yield (SRY) relationships: Storage computation
#' @description Returns the required storage for given inflow time series, yield, and target time-based reliability. Assumes standard operating policy. Storage is computed iteratively using the bi-section method.
#' @param Q               vector or time series object. Net inflow totals to the reservoir. Recommended units: Mm^3 (Million cubic meters).
#' @param yield           the required yield. Must be same volumetric units as Q.
#' @param reliability     numerical. The required time-based reliability.
#' @param demand_profile  a vector of factors with length = frequency(Q). Represents within-year demand profile. Defaults to constant release if left blank.
#' @param plot            logical. If TRUE (the default) the storage behavior diagram and release time series are plotted.
#' @param S_initial       numeric. The initial storage as a ratio of capacity (0 <= S_initial <= 1). The default value is 1.
#' @param max_iterations  Maximum number of iterations for yield computation.
#' @param double_cycle    logical. If TRUE the input series will be replicated and placed end-to-end to double the simulation. (Recommended if the critical period occurs at the end of the recorded inflow time series)
#' @return Returns the required storage capacity necessary to supply specified yield with specified reliability.
#' @examples # Determine the required storage for 95 % reliability and yield equal to 80 % of the mean inflow.
