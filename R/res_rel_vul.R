#' @title Reliability, resilience, and vulnerability analysis for water supply reservoirs
#' @description Computes time-based, annual, and volumetric reliability, as well as resilience and dimensionless vulnerability for a single reservoir.
#' @param Q                  time series or vector. The net inflows to the reservoir.
#' @param target             numerical constant, or a time series or vector of the target releases. Must be the same length as Q is given as a vector or time series.
#' @param capacity           numerical. The reservoir capacity. Should be same volumetric unit as Q and R.
#' @param surface_area       numerical. The reservoir surface area at full capacity. Must be in square kilometers (km^2), or Mm^2.
#' @param max_depth          numerical. The maximum water depth of the reservoir at the dam at maximum capacity. Must be in meters. If omitted, the depth-storage-area relationship will be estimated from surface area and capacity only.
#' @param evap               vector or time series object of length Q, or a numerical constant.  Evaporation from losses from reservoir surface. Varies with level if depth and surface_area parameters are specified. Recommended units: meters, or kg/m2 * 10 ^ -3.
#' @param double_cycle       logical. If TRUE the input series will be replicated and placed end-to-end to double the simulation. (Recommended if the critical period occurs at the end of the recorded inflow time series) 
#' @param plot               logical. If TRUE (the default) the storage behavior diagram and release time series are plotted.
#' @param S_initial          numeric. The initial storage as a ratio of capacity (0 <= S_initial <= 1). The default value is 1.
#' @param policy             list. The output of the SDP function. If omitted, Standard Operating Policy is assumed.
#' @return Returns reliability, resilience and vulnerability metrics based on supply deficits.
