#' @title Storage-Reliability-Yield (SRY) relationships: Yield computation
#' @description Returns the yield for given inflow time series, reservoir capacity, and required time-based reliability. Assumes standard operating policy. Yield is computed iteratively using the bi-section method.
#' @param Q               vector or time series object. Net inflow totals to the reservoir. 
#' @param capacity        numerical. The reservoir storage capacity. Must be in the same volumetric units as Q.
#' @param reliability     numerical. The required time-based reliability.
#' @param demand_profile  a vector of factors with length = frequency(Q). Represents within-year demand profile. Defaults to constant release if left blank.
#' @param plot            logical. If TRUE (the default) the storage behavior diagram and release time series are plotted.
#' @param S_initial       numeric. The initial storage as a ratio of capacity (0 <= S_initial <= 1). The default value is 1.
#' @param max_iterations  Maximum number of iterations for yield computation.
#' @param double_cycle    logical. If TRUE the input series will be replicated and placed end-to-end to double the simulation. (Recommended if the critical period occurs at the end of the recorded inflow time series)
#' @return Returns yield of a reservoir with specified storage capacity and time-based reliability.
