Description: Measure single-storage water supply system performance using
    resilience, reliability, and vulnerability metrics; assess storage-yield-
    reliability relationships; determine no-fail storage with sequent peak analysis;
    optimize release decisions for water supply, hydropower, and multi-objective
    reservoirs using deterministic and stochastic dynamic programming; generate
    inflow replicates using parametric and non-parametric models; evaluate inflow
    persistence using the Hurst coefficient.
