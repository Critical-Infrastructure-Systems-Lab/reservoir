Description: Measure single reservoir performance using resilience, reliability,
    and vulnerability metrics; develop storage-yield-reliability relationships; 
    determine no-fail Rippl storage with sequent peak analysis; optimize release
    decisions using determinisitc and stochastic dynamic programming; evaluate
    inflow characteristics.
