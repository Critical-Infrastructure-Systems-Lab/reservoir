Description: Measure single-storage water supply system performance using resilience, reliability,
    and vulnerability metrics; assess storage-yield-reliability relationships; 
    determine no-fail storage with sequent peak analysis; optimize release
    decisions using deterministic and stochastic dynamic programming; evaluate
    inflow persistence using the Hurst coefficient.
